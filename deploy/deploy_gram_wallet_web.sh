#
# Deploy the Gram Wallet Web build to wallet.ton.org.
#
# wallet.ton.org is GitHub Pages, served from the docs/ directory of the
# ton-blockchain/ton-wallet repo. There is no CI in that repo -- deploys run
# from CI in the public mirror, or manually from a maintainer's machine.
#
# No CDN purge step, on purpose: Cloudflare fronts the domain but does not
# cache the HTML (cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC), the caching layer is the GitHub
# Pages CDN with max-age=600, and asset filenames are content-hashed -- so a
# deploy is fully visible within ~10 minutes with no invalidation call. The
# historical Core Wallet deploys never purged either.
#
# ton-blockchain/ton-wallet IS our public mirror (mytonwallet-org/mytonwallet): same
# 2022 root, differing only by the "core:web:deploy" helper (1a80ba4fb2, the target
# identity anchor used below) and the "[Build]" dist commit. The private dev repo
# shares NO history (re-rooted 2024). So the target is a hosting shell -- only docs/
# is authoritative: drop a fresh build into docs/ and commit it on ton-wallet's
# existing master. NEVER rebase the target onto the private dev master.
#
# The build source must be PUBLISHED on the public mirror and built from a hermetic
# environment. Both are enforced below (sections 1b and 1c) and independently
# re-checked on the built artifact (the environment gates in section 3).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - push (write) access to TARGET_REPO
#   - a clean working tree in THIS dev checkout, on a ref that carries the Gram
#     combo profile
#   - node/npm on PATH
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/deploy_gram_wallet_web.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Env vars:
#   TARGET_REPO           default: git@github.com:ton-blockchain/ton-wallet.git
#   TARGET_BRANCH         default: master
#   PUBLIC_MIRROR_REPO    default: https://github.com/mytonwallet-org/mytonwallet.git
#                         source of truth for the source guard: HEAD must be
#                         reachable from one of its published branch heads
#   ALLOW_UNPUBLISHED_SOURCE  set to 1 to bypass the build-source guard -- ships
#                         UNREVIEWED state, only for deliberate emergencies,
#                         never for a normal deploy
#   ALLOW_TAINTED_BUILD_ENV   set to 1 to bypass the build-env hygiene gate
#                         (local .env / ambient app env); the artifact
#                         environment gates (6-7) still apply
#   WORKDIR               default: <sibling of this dev repo>/ton-wallet-deploy
#
# Rollback (if a bad build reaches wallet.ton.org):
#   Every live deploy first preserves the outgoing remote tip on the TARGET as
#   refs/backup/build-<sha>, so every prior state is recoverable from the
#   remote itself -- no local checkout history or reflog needed (an ephemeral
#   CI runner has neither):
#     git ls-remote git@github.com:ton-blockchain/ton-wallet.git 'refs/backup/*'
#     git clone git@github.com:ton-blockchain/ton-wallet.git && cd ton-wallet
#     git fetch origin '+refs/backup/*:refs/backup/*'
#     git push --force-with-lease=<TARGET_BRANCH> origin refs/backup/build-<sha>:<TARGET_BRANCH>
#   (or simply re-run this script from the previous good source ref). The
#   rolled-back build is live once the Pages CDN cache expires (~10 minutes,
#   see the note above).

# with no app env injected: with the env empty, src/config.ts falls back to
# the production endpoints (verified against the live production web app).
#

#   - a non-empty .env at the repo root (dotenv would load it), and

#     .env.example, but equally baked into the artifact).
# Secret-bearing vars (*_KEY, TEST_MNEMONIC, TEST_PASSWORD, TEST_SESSION) are
# refused even in CI: a public web bundle has no legitimate use for them.
